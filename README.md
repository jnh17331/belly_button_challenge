# Belly Button Challenge
In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Metadata
Filters the data from [https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json](url) this json for the selected patient and grabs all of the metadata associated with them for the charts and information table. 

## Bar Chart
Shows the top 10 OTUs of the selected paitent as well as the count of each OTU.

## Bubble Chart
Each OTU on a bubble chart and displays it's size based on how many of the OTU were found in the patient.
